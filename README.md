✈️ Flight Data Analysis – 2018 Dataset(Kaggle dataset)
Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing a 2018 flight operations dataset containing detailed information about flight schedules, delays, carriers, and airport activities. The notebook guides users through preparing raw CSV data for analysis and extracting meaningful insights about flight performance and delay patterns.

Key Features

Data Loading: Import flight data from Google Drive into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Inspect the dataset structure, preview sample rows, and summarize key characteristics.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare features for further analysis.

Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze delays, departure/arrival trends, and operational performance metrics.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes 28 columns covering:

Flight date, airline carrier, and flight number

Origin and destination airport information

Scheduled vs. actual departure and arrival times

Delay details such as departure delay, arrival delay, taxi times

Cancellation and diversion indicators

Breakdown of delay causes (weather, carrier, security, late aircraft, etc.)

Requirements & Setup

Python 3

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Google Colab (optional), with Google Drive mounting for file access

Usage

Execute the notebook step-by-step to clean, explore, and visualize the flight data.

Adjust the file path to point to your dataset.

Interpret visual outputs to identify trends in delays, airline performance, and operational bottlenecks.
